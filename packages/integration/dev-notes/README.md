# Integration Package - Development Notes

## Package Overview
The `@koios/integration` package provides a comprehensive integration solution with specialized sub-packages for external services.

## Development Guidelines

### Monorepo Structure
- **Main Package**: Core integration utilities and shared functionality
- **Sub-Packages**: Specialized packages for specific services
- **Workspaces**: npm workspaces for efficient dependency management

### Sub-Package Development
1. Each sub-package is self-contained with its own dependencies
2. Follow uniform configuration standards across all sub-packages
3. Implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. Add comprehensive TypeScript types
5. Include demo components for testing and documentation

### Code Structure
- `src/services/` - Service client implementations
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
- `src/components/` - Demo components

### Development Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Build specific sub-package
npm run build --workspace=hugging-face

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Lint all packages
npm run lint
\`\`\`

### API Integration Patterns
- Use axios for HTTP requests with proper error handling
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Add request/response interceptors for logging
- Use proper authentication mechanisms per service

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for service clients
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Mock external API calls in tests
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Security Considerations
- Never commit API keys or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Validate all input parameters

### Release Process
1. Update version in main package.json
2. Update versions in all sub-packages
3. Build all packages
4. Run comprehensive tests
5. Publish main package and sub-packages

## Known Issues
- None currently documented

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add more service integrations (AWS, Azure, etc.)
- [ ] Implement unified authentication system
- [ ] Add rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Create integration testing framework
- [ ] Add monitoring and observability
